        The type of the generated paths is determined by the path_type
        argument, which is a class variable of the ``PathType`` class.
        By default, this argument is ``PathType.WORST_CASE``. For
        a description of the types, refer to the documentation of
        the ``PathType`` class.

        The ``num_paths`` argument is an upper bound on how many paths should
        be generated, which is 5 by default. This argument is ignored if
        this method is used to generate all of the feasible paths of the code
        being analyzed.

        The ``interval`` argument is an ``Interval`` object that represents
        the interval of values that the generated paths can have. If
        no ``Interval`` object is provided, the interval of values is
        considered to be all real numbers.

        This method is idempotent: a second call to this method will produce
        the same list of ``Path`` objects as the first call, assuming that
        nothing has changed between the two calls.

        Precondition: The basis ``Path`` objects of the input ``Analyzer``
        object have values associated with them. Refer to either the method
        ``loadBasisValuesFromFile`` or the method ``loadBasisValues`` in
        the ``Analyzer`` class.

        Arguments:
            analyzer:
                ``Analyzer`` object that maintains information about
                the code being analyzed.

                the ``PathType`` class. The different types of paths are
                described in the documentation of the ``PathType`` class.
